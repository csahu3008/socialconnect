      but while adding a new post you have to add Image which is essential without it post will not be saved
    
    
    * in this website , when connect is clicked in the connect friends section ,it only connects the other user from your side not from your side both of you will be mutually connected when the other user connects with you from his side .in simpler words we can say  it's one way connection
